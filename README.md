# The pet project is a Tic Tac Toe game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technologies Used:  
**HTML:** Provides the structure of the game board.  
**CSS:** Styles the game board and symbols for an appealing user interface.  
**JavaScript:** Implements the game logic, win/draw detection, and user interactions.  

## Features:
**Interactive Game Board:** The game board is represented by a 3x3 grid, and players can click on cells to place their symbols.  
**Real-Time Feedback:** The current player's symbol ('X' or 'O') is displayed when they click on an empty cell.  
**Turn-Based Gameplay:** Players take turns to make their moves, with the system automatically switching between 'X' and 'O' after each move.  
**Win Detection:** The game detects and alerts players when one of them achieves three of their symbols in a row, indicating victory.  
**Draw Detection:** In case all cells are filled, and neither player has won, the game declares a draw.
